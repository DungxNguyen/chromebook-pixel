Upon first installation, plugging in a headphone, or any other audio device, the sound still comes through the main speakers. I'm sure there are a few different ways to remedy this, but for ease of use, here's one I found to be quick and painless.

Install Qasmixer with: sudo apt-get install qasmixer

Run it: qasmixer

Top left of the GUI go to: View> Show Device Selection

Then in the Mixer Device panel in the top right scroll down to sysdefault.

In the bottom left click in the box for HP/Speaker Auto Detect

Hope that helps someone out. Thanks.

Great Gallium!
